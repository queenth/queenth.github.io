                <h3>Tips for paranting Twins</h3>
                <br>
                <li>For parenting help. Be it a single parent or two parent family, reach out to your family, friends and neighbors for support when raising twins. Often people welcome being invited to cuddle, feed or play with a baby. Everyone likes to feel needed. Your friends or family will enjoy being invited over to be with the babies so you can take a nap.</li>

                <li>Develop routines and schedules. A structured and predictable routine helps every family member function to their optimal ability. The daily routine helps your children feel safe because they know what is going to happen and what to expect next. Getting babies on the same sleep schedule, when possible, allows you a few minutes to not run at full speed. As the twin babies grow, they will also be accustomed to following a routine </li>

                <li>Plan individual quality time. Plan for quality time alone with each child. Some quality play time activities, such as sitting and talking, sharing a book, playing a game or going to the market, provide the individual attention that children need. The goal is to give each child life experiences that are fun and appropriate for them. </li>

                <li>Understand fairness vs. respect for children. Because every child has different needs, being respectful is more important than being fair when raising twins. Parents need not always spend the same amount of time with each child, buy the equivalent gift or treat children in the exact same manner. Respecting the similarities and differences of each child fosters a real and healthy sense of self</li>

                <h3>Motherhood</h3>
                <br><br>
                <li> Seek out your local twin group
                Some will have regular meetups which is a brilliant way to connect with other parents of multiples and share tips. If one doesn’t exist locally, there are lots on Facebook and you’re likely to find one in commutable distance if you’re happy to travel</li>
                <li> Being a twin mum can be expensive
                Particularly if they are your first babies and you don’t have any hand me down options. There are specific twin selling pages on Facebook and a category on Vinted for twins</li>
                <li> A twin feeding pillow will be your new best friend. Great for feeding but also for playtime before babies are sitting upright</li>
                <li> Don’t try and keep up with your singleton mum friends
                I don’t mean this to sound in any way divisive. Motherhood is all about winging it together and never about “us and them”. But honestly, in the early days, particularly because our journey to parenthood had been so difficult… I tried to do everything I saw other mums with one baby doing.</li>

                <br><br>
                <li>Taking your babies home with you is a moment to celebrate</li>
                <li>Dividing your time and attention between 2 or more babies can feel overwhelming. You may miss the help and support you had in hospital</li>
                <li> Remember that your health visitor and GP will be there to support you through these early weeks</li> 
                <li> There's no need to bath your babies every day – 2 or 3 times a week is fine. You may like to bath your babies on alternate nights so you can get to know them individually</li>
                
                <li> Put your babies down in a safe sleeping position, on their backs with their feet touching the bottom of the cot or Moses basket</li>
                <li>Use swaddling and white noise for all sleeping and fussy periods</li>
                <li>Have a bedtime routine and stick to it. This will help the babies get into a good settling routine </li>
